- A function to **allocate memory** (`allocate`).
- A function to **free memory** (`free`).
- **Merging of adjacent free blocks** after deallocation to reduce fragmentation.

## 🛠️ Features

- Simulates a heap of **1024 bytes** using C.
- Uses **First-Fit** allocation strategy.
- Maintains linked lists for **free** and **allocated** memory blocks.
- Merges adjacent free blocks on every deallocation.
- Interactive command-line menu.
